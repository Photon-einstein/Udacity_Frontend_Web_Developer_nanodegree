# Tasks:

1. Read the html code, file: 'index.html' (Done)
2. Read the CSS code (Done)
3. Read the data documents: (in progress)
    - aboutMeData.json (Done)

4. View the images inside the image folder (in progress)
5. Create an empty js file, filename: 'scripts.js' (Done)
6. Load the json file into a JS object (Done)

"There are two files that hold the JSON data in the data folder: aboutMeData.json and projectsData.json. While you can technically simply paste the data into your JavaScript file and access it directly, this is an opportunity to get used to fetching external data from an API and using it in your applications. Remember that even though you're fetching data from a JSON source, you still need to run the response object through the `.json()` method in order to return an object you can access. I'd suggest fetching each file and then storing the data as a global variable you can use throughout the JavaScript file."
